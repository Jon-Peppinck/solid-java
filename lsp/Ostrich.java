// In the LSP-compliant version, the Bird hierarchy is refined so that only birds that can fly implement the Flyable interface. Ostrich doesn’t attempt to override a fly() method it can’t support.

// OOP Pillars: Demonstrates Inheritance appropriately by separating flyable and non-flyable birds.

// Best Practices: Encourages Separation of Concerns by distinguishing different behaviors (flyable vs. non-flyable).

public class Ostrich {
  // No fly method, as ostriches cannot fly
}
